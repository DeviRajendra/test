   - Ensure your extensions are up-to-date to benefit from the latest features and security patches.

3. **Customize Settings**:
   - Many extensions offer customizable settings. Tailor them to fit your workflow by accessing the settings (`Ctrl + ,` or `⌘ + ,` on Mac) and searching for the extension’s configuration options.

4. **Use Extension Packs**:
   - Extension packs bundle related extensions together. For example, the “Python Extension Pack” may include several Python-related extensions in one install.

5. **Disable Unused Extensions**:
   - If you’re not actively using certain extensions, consider disabling them to improve performance.
